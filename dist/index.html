                    <p>The participant must be enrolled in the course CBIT 212 (Professional Elective I)</p>
                    <p>The participant must have a Github repository for his/her website.</p>
                    <p>The participant’s website must contain mostly original content.</p>

                <strong><p>There are two elimination rounds.</p></strong>
                <p>1st elimination round – Basic website (can just be a skeleton) should be deployed by Thursday night, 7:30pm with the repository name “access-portfolio” (e.g., www.github.com/USERNAME/access-portfolio).</p>
                <p>2nd elimination round – The near-finished website should be deployed by Wednesday evening (November 20). The criteria is listed on the section. </p>
            </div>

            <div id="criteria">
                <div id="criteria-numbers">
                <p>Content – 20%. Students should include relevant and accurate information. The use of placeholders and copy-pasted content will cause some deductions to the participant’s score. Additional content about the participant’s hobbies, etc. will be a plus.</p>
                <p>Structure and Navigation – 20%. The participant should ensure that the user of the website can easily and properly navigate the website. </p>
                <p>Animations and Transitions – 20%. The participant must attract the user, not only through the layout and design of the website, but also through the visual effects of it.</p>
                <p>Interactivity – 20%. The participant should engage the user to do more than just scrolling and reading through the webpage.</p>
                <p>Originality – 20%. The participant should not make his/her website look generic and bland. The use of CSS frameworks is discouraged, but is allowed as long as the user maintains his/her style and originality. The use of templates derived online is strictly prohibited.</p>
            </div>    
            </br>
                <h4>Additional points are conferred to websites that exhibit:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Responsiveness – scales well across device categories</li>
                    <li>Accessibility and Readability – the website can be read properly</li>
                    <li>Exceptional artistic style – e.g., minimalism, pop-art</li>
                    <li>Compliance to coding conventions and web design trends</li>
                </ul>

                <p>There will only be 5-10 websites to be presented at the IT Day website exhibit. There will probably be a consolation prize or some other form of compensation for other participants who did not win.</p>

            <div id="reward-content">
                <p>A cash prize (amount to be announced soon) will be given to the winner of the contest. Participants who are not eliminated will earn additional points for the Professional Elective 2 class. </p>
